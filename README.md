# astojs

This is a WIP parser and transpiler for a subset of Applescript to ECMAScript 6. It's intended to
aid in migrating Applescript scripts used for scripting Adobe InDesign to ExtendScript. Since it's
meant to be a one-off tool, the emphasis is on producing clean Javascript rather than correctness.

astojs is under heavy development. See [the tests](https://bitbucket.org/MasonM/astojs/src/master/test/astojs_test.js)
for what's it's capable of so far.
